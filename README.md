## Objective

The main goal of this project was to gain familiarity with Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech APIs, as well as to develop an application that functions correctly based on voice commands. In this first version, the virtual assistant has 5 functionalities:
- Daily Agenda
- News
- Voice Notepad
- Google Search
- Open Microsoft Teams
- Extra: Introduction of Artemis (name given to the virtual assistant)


 ## Next Steps
- Improve error handling, i.e., when there are speech recognition problems
- Implement an Alarm feature, allowing the user to ask the assistant to remind them of something at a specific time
- Enhance the Voice Notepad functionality, allowing the user to edit and/or delete specific contents
